Taterm is a terminal emulator tailored to be used with tiling window managers.
There may be special support for various window managers in the future.

# Goals

* Keep the current directory over multiple invocations
    * Single instance via Gtk.Application

* Work on Wayland (maybe, didn't test)

* Use VTE3 (Don't need to reinvent the wheel and everything else around it)

* No gui clutter
    * Window, shell inside, period

* No tabbing (tiling window manager, remember?)

# Features

* Single instance, directory is taken from last focused terminal
* Clicking of URIs
* Scroll lock (WIP)
* Clean build under latest GTK (3.3.18)

# Prerequisites

* The Vala compiler
* libvte-2.91-dev
